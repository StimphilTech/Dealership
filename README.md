# Luxury Cars Dealership

## Description of the Project

Our long-term plan is to have multiple Dealerships and to
let the user choose which Dealership to search and/or add and remove cars
to. Thus, the UserInterface will create the Dealership object when it is
created. Down the road, there will be a user option to "switch dealerships"
